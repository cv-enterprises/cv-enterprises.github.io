Virtual Reality Game Development with ZPX-
 Interactive Software, a gaming company based in Lisbon, Portugal. 
Project started with a 9-week summer internship focused on the software 
engineering industry, specifically learning the company’s detailed 
collaboration process. Our current project is to conceive and create a
user interface (UI) for their latest multiplayer VR game 
(projected release: Spring 2019). Game engines that we use are 
Unity and Unreal (coding in C# and C++)
